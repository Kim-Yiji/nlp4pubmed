40156601,What Do Australians Eat? A Systematic Review of Dietary Patterns and Adverse Health Outcomes.,"CONTEXT: A suboptimal diet is a leading factor in the current burden of chronic diseases. In Australia, dietary factors contribute to one-fifth of the chronic disease burden. Understanding the dietary patterns of Australian adults and summarizing their effects on chronic conditions are imperative for improving interventions targeting dietary behaviors. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to summarize the dietary patterns of Australian adults derived using a posteriori and hybrid analysis methods and their associations with adverse health outcomes. DATA SOURCES: Six databases were first searched in December 2020 and updated in August 2023. DATA EXTRACTION: Cardiometabolic health, cardiovascular mortality, cancer, pregnancy-related metabolic conditions (gestational diabetes mellitus [GDM] or hypertensive disorders during pregnancy [HDP]), mental health, and cognitive function were the main health outcomes. DATA ANALYSIS: Dietary patterns from each study were classified as either healthy or unhealthy. A narrative synthesis was used to describe the association of dietary patterns with adverse health outcomes in longitudinal studies. Fifty-nine observational studies (31 cross-sectional, 3 case-control, 22 longitudinal, and 3 combining both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs) were included, involving a total of 362 263 participants aged 18 years and older. CONCLUSION: Higher adherence to a healthy dietary pattern (characterized by higher consumption of dark-yellow, green leafy, cruciferous vegetables and fruits, nuts, whole grains, tomatoes, fish, and low-fat dairy) is associated with improved cardiometabolic risk factors, reduced risk of GDM and HDP, better mental health, and improved pregnancy outcomes. On the other hand, an unhealthy dietary pattern (characterized by a higher intake of processed and red meat, takeaway foods, white bread, high-fat dairy, potatoes, discretionary fat, sweet snacks, soft drinks, fat spreads, jam, and Vegemite) is linked to increased cardiometabolic risks. Overall, while healthy dietary patterns are associated with a reduced risk of several physical and mental health outcomes, unhealthy dietary patterns are linked to an increased risk in Australian adults.

40156553,"Patient Perceptions of the Palliative Recovery Engagement Program (P-REP) Clinic, a Novel Outpatient Model for Patients With Advanced Illness and Substance Misuse.","Substance use disorder in patients with cancer and other advanced illness is increasingly recognized as an emergent problem, and it has been associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The Palliative Recovery Engagement Program (P- REP) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), U.S.A, is an interdisciplinary clinic housed within an outpatient addiction program. It was formed in 2020 to care for individuals who have advanced illness, primarily cancer, who also experience substance misuse. We conducted semi-structured interviews with clinic patients to better understand their experience with pain management prior to arrival and while at P-REP. We identified factors that can influence the therapeutic relationship in this setting where conflict often predominates, such as a patient's coping mechanisms, their prior experiences with stigma, recovery programs, buprenorphine, and their ideas about abstinence, recovery, and the safety of their own patterns of opioid use. Notably, we found that clinicians who are familiar with these factors may feel more prepared to facilitate conversations, negotiate through shared decision making, and help maintain the therapeutic relationship, even when the provider and patient strongly disagree.",2025 Mar 29,The American journal of hospice & palliative care,"Zhou A, Hamm M, Merlin JS, Childers JW"
40156510,"Storytelling sessions for PrEP/ART education and psychosocial support among expectant serodiscordant couples: results from a pilot feasibility trial in Zambezia Province, Mozambique.","Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is offered to pregnant HIV-uninfected women in serodiscordant relationships in Mozambique, yet uptake is still low. We conducted a randomized feasibility trial of PrEP education and psychosocial support to serodiscordant expectant couples via three storytelling sessions in two districts within Zambezia Province. Data were collected between December 2020 and December 2022. We recruited 64 couples (31 control and 33 intervention) from two health facilities. We assessed the intervention's effect on psychosocial metrics related to PrEP (stigma, treatment self-efficacy, treatment expectations, relationship satisfaction, social support), retention in clinical services, and participants' acceptability of each storytelling session. Among couples randomized to the intervention, 24 (73%) completed all three sessions. No impact was seen on median medication possession ratio (among women: 74.0% and 73.8% [p = 0.514]; among men: 78.3% and 75.4% [p = 0.543] for control and intervention groups, respectively). Surveys revealed no change in PrEP stigma, treatment self-efficacy, treatment expectations, or relationship satisfaction. In interviews, participants reported increased PrEP knowledge, improved trust, capacity, and motivation to remain adherent to their medications. Some described low PrEP awareness within their communities and suggested community-based educational sessions. In-person narrative-style storytelling could be an acceptable method of conveying PrEP information to serodiscordant couples in rural areas in Mozambique.",2025 Mar 29,AIDS care,"De Schacht C, Brooks HL, Graves E, Emilio A, Matino A, Oyekunle T, Aboobacar A, Audet CM"
40156447,Innovative pre-treatments for reverse osmosis to reclaim water from biotech and municipal wastewater for the industrial symbiosis in Kalundborg.,"The challenge of water reclamation using membranes in this study was the quite unique wastewater composition resulting from a high share of biotech wastewater. The high content of organic matter and high concentrations of calcium, bicarbonate, and sulphate were considered as challenging for membrane processes. Consequently, an innovative ultra-tight ultrafiltration (u-t UF) membrane was developed and tested on-site at pilot scale. In comparison, a conventional UF and an open nanofiltration (NF) were piloted. The aim was to find the best pre-treatment option for reverse osmosis (RO) to reduce fouling and scaling and produce fit-for-purpose water; for example, cooling. Overall, the quality of the currently used water source was surpassed by the pilot plant. Only a standard post-treatment of the RO permeate was necessary for stabilisation. Results indicated that denser membranes only minimally reduced fouling of RO. An assessment comparing the treatment trains in a life cycle assessment using the data collected from the pilot operation (UF/NF operating settings, RO plant performance, and the design of multi-stage industrial scale RO) revealed lower greenhouse gas emissions compared to seawater desalination. However, if the RO brine treatment becomes mandatory, the greenhouse gas emissions from water reclamation and supply will be higher than those from freshwater supply.",2025 Mar,Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,"Jahrig J, Kleybocker A, Kraus F, Melchiorsen LR, Milter H, Thisgaard P, Vredenbregt L, Miehe U"
40156414,Comparison Between Breath-Hold and the Inspiratory Phase of Free Breathing in Left Breast Cancer Radiotherapy: Target Volume Coverage and Organ Sparing.,"BACKGROUND: Cardiac mortality and coronary events associated with left breast radiotherapy are correlated with the mean radiation dose to the heart. METHODS: This prospective phase II study included left breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant locoregional radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) following surgery. Patients were treated using the respiratory gating (RPM) technique (Varian Medical Systems, USA). Dosimetric outcomes were compared between deep inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) and the inspiratory phase of free breathing (FB) in the same patients, focusing on target volume coverage and sparing of critical organs (lungs, heart, and coronary arteries). The prescribed dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions over five weeks to the chest wall or breast and/or lymph nodes, with an additional boost of 10 Gy in five fractions over one week to the tumor bed in breast-conserving surgery (BCS) cases. Two treatment plans were generated per patient: one for DIBH and another for the inspiratory phase of FB. RESULTS: Between February 2020 and August 2022, 60 patients with a mean age of 50 years were enrolled in the study. The dosimetric analysis showed that the mean heart dose was lower in the DIBH group (4.8 Gy) compared to the FB group (6.4 Gy) with a statistically significant difference (p < 0.0001). Similarly, the mean dose to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was significantly reduced in DIBH (14 Gy) compared to FB (20.5 Gy) (p < 0.0001). Regarding target volume coverage, the mean planning target volume (PTV) V95% was slightly higher in DIBH (97.3%) than in FB (96.5%) (p = 0.0062). The mean left lung V20 was comparable between the two techniques, with values of 14.4% in DIBH and 14.35% in FB (p = 0.85), indicating no significant difference in lung dose sparing. However, the mean left ventricular dose was significantly lower in DIBH (6 Gy) compared to FB (8.1 Gy) (p < 0.0001), further supporting the advantage of DIBH in reducing cardiac radiation exposure. CONCLUSION: DIBH plans demonstrated superior target coverage and significantly improved cardiac and coronary sparing compared to FB inspiratory phase plans. However, FB plans remained within acceptable dose constraints. No significant differences were observed in lung dose sparing or beam-on time.",2025 Mar 1,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,"Hussein SH, Kassem L, Adrosy MI, Metwally H"
40156395,Role of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) Expression as a Prediction of Persistent Cervical Low Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion (LSIL).,"BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer rates have been decreasing due to improved screening programs targeting HPV infections. Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (CIN), including CIN 1, can regress, persist, or progress, leading to patient anxiety. The expression of Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) may serve as an indicator of poor cancer outcomes and could potentially predict the persistence of CIN 1. OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between COX-2 expression and the persistence of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) or CIN 1. Additionally, to compare baseline characteristics between patients with persistent and regressive LSIL/CIN 1. METHODS: This case-control study included patients diagnosed with CIN 1 at least 12 months prior to the study started and followed up between May 2019 and April 2020. Pelvic examination and liquid-based cytology collection were performed. Participants were divided into two groups: regressive and persistent, based on current examination results. Previous cervical biopsy slides were reviewed by two gynecologic pathologists to confirm the CIN 1 diagnosis. Paraffin blocks from selected samples underwent immunohistochemistry staining to evaluate COX-2 expression, which was assessed using the Allred score. Clinical risk factors, cervical cytology, HPV genotype, and Allred scores were analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 161 patients recruited, 132 were in the regressive group and 29 in the persistent group, yielding a regression rate of 81.99%. COX-2 expression was observed in 83.8% of the patients. In the regressive group, 110 out of 132 patients tested positive for COX-2, while 25 out of 29 patients in the persistent group were COX-2 positive. Median Allred scores were similar between the groups, with no significant correlation between COX-2 expression and persistent LSIL/CIN 1 (p = 0.663). Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between Allred scores, high-risk HPV infection, and high-risk HPV status (p = 0.66 and p = 0.80). Persistent detection of high-risk HPV was found to be a significant risk factor for persistent LSIL in univariate analysis (p = 0.001), but not in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: COX-2 expression and HPV status do not appear to predict persistent LSIL/CIN 1. Further research is needed to identify reliable predictors for the persistence of LSIL/CIN 1.",2025 Mar 1,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,"Homsup P, Pohthipornthawat N, Ariyasriwatana C, Oranratanaphan S"
40156389,Exploring Burnout Trends: A Longitudinal Comparative Study of Lebanese Oncologists in Response to Socioeconomic and Pandemic Challenges.,"INTRODUCTION: Occupational Burnout involves a prolonged state of stress in the workplace. Healthcare workers, particularly oncologists, are highly susceptible to burnout. METHODS: The study conducted over a 3-month period among Lebanese oncologists through an online survey comprising two sections: one collecting socio-demographic and work-related data, and the other assessing burnout using the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). RESULTS: The study surveyed 48 out of 65 oncologists working at hospitals in Lebanon. The majority were male, over 45 years old, and specialized in medical oncology. Economic challenges during the pandemic impacted oncologists, with a majority experiencing income decreases and expressing dissatisfaction with compensation. Emotional exhaustion and depersonalization significantly increased while the sense of personal accomplishment decreased among oncologists from 2018 to 2023, indicating a rise in burnout prevalence. DISCUSSION: The prevalence of burnout among Lebanese oncologists hit a high levels, reflecting systemic issues within the Lebanese healthcare system and the impact of traumatic events. Age, work environment, and financial stability emerge as key factors influencing burnout and job satisfaction among oncologists. Hence, highlighting the intricate relationship between economic challenges and mental well-being in healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: The study highlights a notable increase in burnout levels among Lebanese oncologists, attributed to systemic challenges, economic collapse, COVID-19 pandemic, and the Beirut blast.",2025 Mar 1,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,"El-Halabi LN, Charafeddine M, Tfayli A"
40156388,Role of SNHGs in Adverse Prognostic Factors in Cervical Cancer: A Systematic Review.,"OBJECTIVE: This study aims to summarize the main findings in the literature regarding the family of long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs), specifically SNHGs, in cervical cancer. METHODS: The study was conducted following the PRISMA protocol, using the PICOS framework for the search strategy. The research sources included PubMed, ScienceDirect, Lilacs, and Medline. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, and data from each article were extracted, including: clinicopathological characteristics, biological function of SNHGs, clinical indicators, and diagnostic and prognostic markers. RESULTS: Out of a total of 3.803 studies, 12 were selected, encompassing 8 SNHGs (GAS5, SNHG5, SNHG7, SNHG12, SNHG14, SNHG16, SNHG17, and SNHG20) associated with cervical cancer. All, except for GAS5, showed increased expression. In the literature review, SNHG expression was linked to adverse prognostic factors in cervical cancer, such as proliferation, migration, invasion, lymph node metastasis, and apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Although further studies are needed, these data highlight the significant role of SNHGs in tumor biology and the promising potential of this class of transcripts as tools in the clinical management of cervical cancer.",2025 Mar 1,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,"Araujo EA, Lima FJL, Cartagenes MDSS, Silva GEB, Silva JMCD, Khayat AS, Moreira FC, Oliveira AGC, Matos AGM, Pinho JD, Andrade MS"
40156344,Trichophyton mentagrophytes Genotype VII and Sexually Transmitted Tinea: An Observational Study in Spain.,"BACKGROUND: In 2019, Trichophyton mentagrophytes genotype VII (TMVII) was identified in Germany as a cause of sexually transmitted tinea. Since 2023, it has been described in men who have sex with men (MSM) in France, Italy, and the United States. No cases have been reported in Spain. OBECTIVES: Our study aimed to assess the occurrence of TMVII in an STI clinic in Barcelona. PATIENTS/METHODS: We identified TMVII cases among all positive mycological skin/hair cultures between January 2020 and January 2025 by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer on isolates of T. mentagrophytes-interdigitale. We retrospectively collected demographic, clinical and treatment data and analysed the association between treatment received and outcome (cure vs. recurrence). RESULTS: Among 21 positive cultures, we obtained 15 isolates of T. mentagrophytes-interdigitale, of which 14 were sequenced and identified as TMVII. Patients with TMVII were all MSM; most were HIV positive (7) or negative on preexposure prophylaxis (6). Main sites of infection were pubogenital (6), buttocks-perianal (5) and beard (2). Six patients required multiple courses of treatment due to recurrence. Twenty-one courses of antifungal therapy were analysed, with an observed cure rate of 45% (5/11) for oral terbinafine vs. 80% (7/10) for topical agents (p = 0.39), and 0% (0/6) for </= 2-week courses vs. 80% (12/15) for 3-to-8-week courses (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms the presence of TMVII in Spain, supporting its circulation across Europe. Epidemiological profile and site of infection support sexual transmission. Patients responded to systemic or topical terbinafine but required longer-than-usual periods of treatment.",2025 Apr,Mycoses,"Descalzo V, Martin MT, Alvarez-Lopez P, Garcia-Perez JN, Alcazar-Fuoli L, Lopez-Perez L, Tellez-Velasco D, Carrillo A, Sulleiro E, Falco V, Arando M"
40156318,Effects of Early Midlife Ovarian Removal on Medial Temporal Lobe Gray Matter Volume and Recognition Memory.,"Early midlife bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is associated with greater Alzheimer's disease risk compared to spontaneous/natural menopause. Previously, we found that participants with BSO had lower volume in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and cornu ammonis 2/3 composite subfield (DG-CA2/3). We sought to extend those hippocampal subfield findings by assessing whether BSO affected volumes along the anteroposterior hippocampal axis, anterolateral entorhinal cortex, and perirhinal cortex subregions (Brodmann area (BA) 35 and 36). We also correlated volumes with key demographic and wellbeing-related factors (age, depressive mood, education), hormone therapy characteristics, and recognition memory performance. Early midlife participants with BSO (with and without 17beta-estradiol therapy (ET)) and age-matched control participants with intact ovaries (AMC) completed high-resolution T2-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Medial temporal lobe volumes and Remember-Know task recognition memory performance were compared between groups-BSO (n = 23), BSO + ET (n = 28), AMC (n = 34) using univariate analyses. Multivariate Partial Least Squares (PLS) analyses were used to examine how volumes related to demographic and wellbeing-related factors, as well as hormone therapy characteristics. Relative to BSO + ET, BSO had lower posterior hippocampal and DG-CA2/3 volumes but greater perirhinal BA 36 volumes. Compared to age, depressive mood, and education, ET was the strongest positive predictor of hippocampal volumes and negative predictor of perirhinal BA 36 volumes. For BSO + ET, hippocampal volumes were negatively related to ET duration and positively related to concurrent progestogen therapy. Relative to AMC, BSO had greater anterolateral entorhinal cortex and perirhinal BA 35 and BA 36 volumes. BSO groups (with and without ET) relied more on familiarity than recollection for successful recognition memory. BSO and ET may have distinct effects on medial temporal lobe volumes, with potential implications for memory processes affected by Alzheimer's disease risk.",2025 May,Hippocampus,"Brown A, Gervais NJ, Gravelsins L, Zhao S, Duchesne A, Rieck J, Mouzenian A, Calvo N, Mazloum-Farzaghi N, Olsen R, Barense M, Shao Z, Bernardini M, Jacobson M, Rajah MN, Grady C, Einstein G"
