"Although investigators claimed vitamin A could treat or prevent a variety of infections from puerperal sepsis to the common cold, the poor quality of many of the trials and the lack of appreciation for the context in which they were conducted (the nutritional status of the study subjects, the nature of the infectious agent, etc.) resulted in seemingly conflicting results (23,24).",vitamin A,18806089,1

"Although nutrition and infectious disease experts occasionally called attention to the potential antiinfectious properties of vitamin A (28), interest in the 1960s–1980s was primarily focused on elucidating the biochemical pathways governing vitamin A absorption, storage, distribution, and action (29, 30, 31).",vitamin A,18806089,1
"The existence and properties of cellular and nuclear receptors, the conversion of carotenes to retinol, and the role that vitamin A plays in regulating gene function remain topics of continuing discovery and interest.",vitamin A,18806089,0
"When nutritionists and physicians turned again to the clinical importance of vitamin A deficiency, as they did at an international meeting in 1974 convened by WHO and the U.S. Agency for International Development, they noted the increased mortality associated with xerophthalmia but stressed the public health importance of blinding xerophthalmia in the developing world (32).",vitamin A,18806089,1

We estimated that preventing all xerophthalmia (and its associated vitamin A deficiency) would reduce the mortality of young Indonesian children by 16%.,vitamin A,18806089,1
"In addition, the monotonic relationship between mortality rates and the severity of xerophthalmia suggested that even “subclinical” deficiency (unaccompanied by ocular changes) might be associated with increased mortality as well.",vitamin A,18806089,1

"In the 5 (of 6) Asian trials, the level of impact was surprisingly similar: a reduction in mortality of 29–54%.",vitamin A,18806089,1
"Most of the deaths prevented were associated with measles and diarrheal disease, not because the incidence of measles or diarrheal disease was reduced but because the clinical manifestations among those receiving vitamin A supplements were less severe (2,37, 38, 39).",vitamin A,18806089,1
"Interest in vitamin A, at both the molecular and clinical level, continues, with potentially important implications for global health policy.",vitamin A,18806089,0
"Recent studies, for example, have suggested that dosing expectant mothers in populations where deficiency is common and maternal mortality high can dramatically reduce the maternal mortality ratio (54) and dosing newborn infants with 50,000 IU (15 mg) vitamin A within 2 d of birth, can significantly reduce neonatal mortality (55, 56, 57).",vitamin A,18806089,2
"Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) affects hundreds of thousands of children globally, particularly in low‐ and middle‐income countries (LMIC), and increases their risk of morbidity and mortality.",vitamin A,31797386,1
"Results from large randomized, controlled trials have indicated that vitamin A supplementation (VAS) of children conducted in areas with a high risk of VAD reduces mortality.",vitamin A,31797386,1
"Based on these results, national programs have been implemented in multiple countries to provide children with high‐dose VAS distribution semiannually.",vitamin A,31797386,2
"In many countries, VAS distribution has been linked to vaccination campaign platforms, such as Child Health Days (CHD).",vitamin A,31797386,0
"These programs were initially intended as a short‐term solution, to mitigate the loss of life, while other medium‐ and long‐term strategies to address underlying VAD and low intake were put in place, but have now been operating for decades in many countries.",vitamin A,31797386,0
"While some countries have made progress in addressing VAD through other programs, such as fortification (e.g., Guatemala), many countries either do not have such alternative programs in place, or the programs are not functioning well.",vitamin A,31797386,0
"At the same time, as vaccine‐preventable diseases such as polio near eradication, funding for the delivery platforms that have been used for VAS distribution has been reduced.",vitamin A,31797386,0
"Some countries (e.g., Ethiopia) have switched to other delivery platforms for VAS, such as during routine healthcare contacts, but these systems are often weak in low‐income settings.",vitamin A,31797386,0
Countries that lose funding for twice‐annual VAS distribution but do not yet have other systems in place for VAS distribution or other vitamin A (VA) programs will be at risk of experiencing increased child mortality.,vitamin A,31797386,1
Vitamin A supplementation is being used successfully to treat some forms of cancer and the degenerative eye disease retinitis pigmentosa.,vitamin A,10197566,1
The daily biological need for vitamin A is estimated to be 800 retinol equivalents (RE)/d (2667 IU/d) for adult women and 1000 RE/d (3300 IU/d) for adult men; doses ≥7500 RE (≥25000 IU)/d are considered potentially toxic over the long term.,vitamin A,10197566,2
We assessed the safety in adults of long-term vitamin A supplementation with doses above the daily biological need but <7500 RE (<25000 IU)/d.,vitamin A,10197566,2
Adults aged 18–54 y with retinitis pigmentosa but in generally good health (n = 146) were supplemented with 4500 RE (15000 IU) vitamin A/d for ≤12 y (group A) and compared with a similar group (n = 149) that received 23 RE (75 IU)/d (trace group).,vitamin A,10197566,2
"Mean total consumption of vitamin A in group A was 5583 RE (18609 IU)/d (range: 4911–7296 RE/d, or 16369–24318 IU/d) and that in the trace group was 1053 RE (3511 IU)/d (range: 401–3192 RE/d, or 1338–10638 IU/d).",vitamin A,10197566,2
"Patients in group A showed an 8% increase in mean serum retinol concentration at 5 y and an 18% increase at 12 y (P < 0.001); no retinol value exceeded the upper normal limit (3.49 μmol/L, or 100 μg/dL).",vitamin A,10197566,2
Prolonged daily consumption of <7500 RE (<25000 IU) vitamin A/d can be considered safe in this age group.,vitamin A,10197566,2
"Vitamin A hepatotoxicity, typically associated with elevated concentrations of liver enzymes such as aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), has been documented in persons chronically supplemented with doses of vitamin A ≥7500 RE (≥25000 IU)/d.",vitamin A,10197566,2
"Only limited evidence is available to suggest that long-term supplementation with vitamin A (≤7500 RE/d, or ≤25000 IU/d) may lead to hepatotoxicity in certain individuals.",vitamin A,10197566,2
"For example, Krasinski et al suggested that elevated liver enzymes were more prevalent in elderly patients with elevated plasma retinyl esters resulting from long-term supplementation with 151–7500 RE (5000–25000 IU) vitamin A/d and that in that group plasma retinyl esters ≥380 nmol/L might indicate potential hepatotoxicity.",vitamin A,10197566,2
"Ellis et al suggested that individuals with severe hypertriacylglycerolemia (>4.5 mmol/L, or >400 mg/dL) are at greater risk of developing vitamin A toxicity.",vitamin A,10197566,3
"Because no systematic documentation exists on supervised, long-term supplementation with moderate amounts (4500–7500 RE/d, or 15000–25000 IU/d) of vitamin A, the present study was initiated to address outstanding questions concerning vitamin A supplementation for up to 12 y in adults with retinitis pigmentosa in generally good health.",vitamin A,10197566,2
"Long-term supplementation with vitamin A [4500 RE (15000 IU)/d, plus the usual dietary load] was assessed for its effect on fasting serum concentrations of retinol, retinyl esters, and triacylglycerols, as well as on the relation between serum retinyl esters and liver enzymes that signal the possibility of hepatic toxicity.",vitamin A,10197566,2
Distribution of serum retinol values in patients with retinitis pigmentosa in group A (n = 115) at year 0 and at year 3 and year 5 of supplementation with 4500 RE (15000 IU) vitamin A/d.,vitamin A,10197566,2
"Among patients in group A, serum retinol increased comparably in the subgroups with total retinol intake <6000 RE (<20000 IU)/d (ie, 4911–5999 RE/d, or 16369–19999 IU/d) and ≥6000 RE (≥20000 IU)/d (ie, 6000–7296 RE/d, or 20000–24318 IU/d), in the subgroups with serum triacylglycerols ≤2.13 and >2.13 mmol/L, and in the subgroups with daily alcohol intake ≤15 and >15 g/d (Table 2).",vitamin A,10197566,2
"We hypothesized that dose escalation of vitamin A to 50,000 or 75,000 IU/day would be both safe and more efficacious in skin cancer chemoprevention.",vitamin A,15041701,2
"One hundred and twenty-nine participants with severely sun-damaged skin on their lateral forearms were randomized to receive placebo or 25,000, 50,000, or 75,000 IU/day vitamin A for 12 months.",vitamin A,15041701,2
"Karyometric features were computed from the basal cell layer of skin biopsies, and a total of 22,600 nuclei from 113 participants were examined, showing statistically significant, dose-response effects for vitamin A at the 25,000 and 50,000 IU/day doses.",vitamin A,15041701,2
"These karyometric changes correlated with increases in retinoic acid receptor α, retinoic acid receptor β, and retinoid X receptor α at the 50,000 IU/day vitamin A dose.",vitamin A,15041701,2
"The vitamin A doses of 50,000 and 75,000 IU/day for 1 year proved safe and equally more efficacious than the 25,000 IU/day dose and can be recommended for future skin cancer chemoprevention studies.",vitamin A,15041701,2
"The International Vitamin A Consultative Group (IVACG) endorses the recommendation from a meeting organized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in February 2000 that a dose of 50,000 international units (iu) of vitamin A should be given with each of the three doses of diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT) that are recommended at (or as soon as possible after) 6, 10 and 14 wk of age (Table 1).",vitamin A,12221268,2
The rationale for this increase has three main pillars.,vitamin A,12221268,0
"First, a large multicenter trial conducted in Ghana, India and Peru showed that, although 25,000 iu of vitamin A given with each dose of DPT at ∼6, 10 and 14 wk was very safe, with only a small increase in transient side effects and no increase in other morbidity, this dosing regimen had only a marginal effect on vitamin A status at 6 mo that was not sustained to 9 mo, and it had no significant effect on morbidity.",vitamin A,12221268,2
"Second, small randomized placebo-controlled trials in Bangladesh of either 25,000 iu or 50,000 iu given with each dose of DPT at ∼6, 11 and 16 wk revealed similar absolute increases of 8–12% in the incidence of bulging fontanel for both dosages.",vitamin A,12221268,2
"A much smaller absolute increase in the incidence of bulging fontanel (0.5%) was reported from a much larger trial in Nepal that used a single 100,000-iu dose in 1- to 5-mo-olds and in the multicenter trial.",vitamin A,12221268,2
"Third, calculations of requirements indicate that even three 50,000-iu doses barely meet requirements in young breast-fed infants of deficient mothers, even if the mother receives a high-dose supplement as soon as possible after delivery.",vitamin A,12221268,2
"Although the recommendation to give 50,000 iu of vitamin A with each dose of DPT at or as soon as possible after 6, 10 and 14 wk of age should be implemented immediately, randomized controlled trials (perhaps comparing this regimen with the lower 25,000-iu three-time regimen) are recommended to study the impact of this regimen on vitamin A status and morbidity and mortality, with suitable monitoring of short-term side effects.",vitamin A,12221268,2
"Programs should also carefully consider the possibility of introducing an additional 50,000-iu dose of vitamin A given directly to newborn infants as soon as possible after birth.",vitamin A,12221268,2
"Two randomized, placebo-controlled trials in Asia have now shown this dosage to substantially reduce infant mortality.",vitamin A,12221268,1
"The first trial was carried out in infants born in a large hospital in Bandung, Indonesia, and reported a staggering 74% (95% CI = 15, 85%) lower infant mortality in the supplemented neonates.",vitamin A,12221268,1
Most of the functions of vitamin A are mediated through the binding of retinoic acid to specific nuclear receptors that regulate genomic expression.,vitamin A,10799410,0
Recent experimental work in transgenic mice showed clearly that normal embryonic development depends on the correct spatial and temporal expression of the receptors in the differentiating cells and on the binding of specific forms of retinoic acid.,vitamin A,10799410,0
"This implies that the parent compound, vitamin A, is available in adequate forms and quantities.",vitamin A,10799410,0
Excessive dietary intake of vitamin A has been associated with teratogenicity in humans in <20 reported cases over 30 y.,vitamin A,10799410,1
"However, caution must be exercised to avoid unnecessary supplementation of women of childbearing age.",vitamin A,10799410,3
Hypovitaminosis A affects millions of women and children worldwide.,vitamin A,10799410,1
The main consequence of a poor vitamin A supply during pregnancy is a low vitamin A status at birth and in the next few months.,vitamin A,10799410,3
"Vitamin A deficiency is strongly associated with depressed immune function and higher morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases such as diarrhea, measles, and respiratory infections.",vitamin A,10799410,1
Vitamin A deficiency is often associated with an increased mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1.,vitamin A,10799410,3
Vitamin A is an essential micronutrient whose role in visual function has been known for thousands of years.,vitamin A,10799410,0
"The role vitamin A plays in other basic physiologic processes, such as growth, reproduction, immunity, and epithelial tissue maintenance, has been known for a long time but is only partially understood.",vitamin A,10799410,0
"Vitamin A is essential throughout the entire life span, yet its influence is particularly critical during periods when cells proliferate rapidly and differentiate, such as during pregnancy and early childhood.",vitamin A,10799410,3
"This review focuses on the metabolism and functions of vitamin A during the periconceptional period, pregnancy, and early childhood.",vitamin A,10799410,3
The consequences on health of inadequate vitamin A status or supply are also discussed.,vitamin A,10799410,1
Vitamin A exerts its functions through oxidized metabolites of retinol.,vitamin A,10799410,0
"The first metabolite, retinaldehyde, constitutes the heme of the visual pigment, the rhodopsin, whose light-induced isomerization triggers a phototransduction cascade that ends with a signal transmission to neurons of the optical nerves.",vitamin A,10799410,0
"The second metabolite, retinoic acid, is a lipid-soluble hormone that controls gene transcription through receptor-mediated events.",vitamin A,10799410,0
The prescription of supplemental vitamin A has been reported to induce intracranial hypertension.,vitamin A,10799410,1
"A bulging fontanelle is often reported in infants and young children, yet such an outcome remains limited and should not prevent the administration of doses ≤50 000 IU [15 000 retinol equivalents (RE)] to neonates when vitamin A status is critically low at birth or later.",vitamin A,10799410,2
Other symptoms related to chronic hypervitaminosis A are observed after supplementation with low to moderate doses of vitamin A on a regular basis over a long period of time.,vitamin A,10799410,1
"This may induce severe, yet usually reversible liver damage.",vitamin A,10799410,1
"Teratogenesis of high vitamin A intakes has been reported in several animal species, as reviewed by Hathcock et al.",vitamin A,10799410,3
"The pattern of birth defects sometimes called retinoic acid syndrome includes central nervous system, craniofacial, cardiovascular, and thymus malformations.",vitamin A,10799410,3
"Similar abnormalities were observed in humans when pregnancies occurred during therapeutic treatment with retinoic acid, especially 13-cis-retinoic acid.",vitamin A,10799410,3
Up to 20 case reports of the relation between a high vitamin A intake and an adverse pregnancy outcome in humans were published in the past 30 y.,vitamin A,10799410,3
Only one prospective study has been conducted to date and the results of this study are clearly inconsistent with those of the retrospective studies.,vitamin A,10799410,0
"The prospective study showed that an intake exceeding 10 000 IU (3000 RE) vitamin A significantly increased the risk of malformations (prevalence ratio: 4.8; 95% CI: 2.2, 10.5).",vitamin A,10799410,2
A clinical trial was carried out in Hungary in which a supplement of 6000 IU (1800 RE) vitamin A did not increase the incidence of fetal malformations.,vitamin A,10799410,2
"Thus, the teratogenicity of high vitamin A intakes during pregnancy remains unclear and it is unlikely that new findings will shed light on this issue over the next few years.",vitamin A,10799410,3
"Human clinical trials are not ethically possible, so we must rely on those already performed, on forthcoming epidemiologic trials, and on our knowledge of vitamin A metabolism and functions, which is largely derived from animal studies.",vitamin A,10799410,0
"This information clearly shows that the teratogenicity of vitamin A is biologically and physiologically possible, yet its real occurrence in humans seems limited.",vitamin A,10799410,3
One drawback in all human studies is that the specific effects of vitamin A intake cannot be determined.,vitamin A,10799410,0
"Most of the information comes from the use of supplements or, at best, supplemented foods, that are taken on a regular basis and in moderate doses.",vitamin A,10799410,0
"However, data from animal studies clearly show that one single, high dose of vitamin A can be teratogenic, provided it is given at a critical period of embryonic development.",vitamin A,10799410,3
"Such information is not available today in humans; thus, any attempt to establish a safe threshold of vitamin A consumption during the early period of human pregnancy would be hazardous.",vitamin A,10799410,3
More recent studies in RAR and RXR null mutant mice clearly confirm the role of vitamin A in embryonic development.,vitamin A,10799410,3
"Interestingly, a study in rats showed that retinol is required during midgestation for neonatal survival.",vitamin A,10799410,3
"In the absence of retinol, the pups exhibited a lethal failure in lung development.",vitamin A,10799410,3
This seems similar to the respiratory distress syndrome observed in premature infants whose vitamin A status is often deficient.,vitamin A,10799410,3
Severe vitamin A deficiency is also responsible for abnormal spermatogenesis in animals.,vitamin A,10799410,1
"In light of these findings, a higher incidence of malformed babies would be expected in areas of endemic vitamin A deficiency, but this is not the case.",vitamin A,10799410,3
"Although this apparent discrepancy may arise from the failure to report birth defects in these countries, the number of reported cases remains surprisingly low.",vitamin A,10799410,0
The few cases reported occurred in India.,vitamin A,10799410,0
"One study reported 15 cases of microphthalmia or anophthalmia over a 10-y period, which is not considerably excessive.",vitamin A,10799410,0
Recent studies in Asia have shown that pregnant and breast-feeding women in poor populations can have a very high prevalence of night blindness and biochemical vitamin A deficiency.,vitamin A,10799410,3
This is likely to be harmful both to the woman and to her infant and argues for considering providing prophylactic vitamin A supplements to pregnant and breast-feeding women or even to all women of childbearing age (13–49 y).,vitamin A,10799410,3
High doses of vitamin A should not be given to women within this age range who could be pregnant because of the risk of teratogenic effects in the fetus.,vitamin A,10799410,3
"There is strong evidence, however, that a vitamin A dose of up to 10,000 iu given daily, or a dose of up to 25,000 iu given weekly, is safe.",vitamin A,10799410,2
"One randomized placebo-controlled trial in Nepal of ∼23,000 iu of vitamin A given every week to all married women of childbearing age has reported a very substantial 40% (95% CI = 3, 63%) reduction in maternal mortality related to pregnancy.",vitamin A,10799410,3
"Further efficacy trials of this intervention are in progress in Bangladesh and Ghana, and IVACG should be in a position to issue a specific recommendation on whether pregnant women (or all women of childbearing age) living in areas where vitamin A deficiency is a public health problem should receive prophylactic vitamin A supplementation as soon as these two trials report their results.",vitamin A,10799410,3
Studies in animals indicate that natural forms of vitamin A are teratogenic.,vitamin A,7477116,3
"Synthetic retinoids chemically similar to vitamin A cause birth defects in humans; as in animals, the defects appear to affect tissues derived from the cranial neural crest.",vitamin A,7477116,3

"Nurse interviewers obtained information on the women's diet, medications, and illnesses during the first trimester of pregnancy, as well as information on their family and medical history and exposure to environmental agents.",vitamin A,7477116,0
We obtained information on the outcomes of pregnancy from the obstetricians who delivered the babies or from the women themselves.,vitamin A,7477116,0
"Of the 22,748 women, 339 had babies with birth defects; 121 of these babies had defects occurring in sites that originated in the cranial neural crest.",vitamin A,7477116,3
"For defects associated with cranial-neural-crest tissue, the ratio of the prevalence among the babies born to women who consumed more than 15,000 IU of preformed vitamin A per day from food and supplements to the prevalence among the babies whose mothers consumed 5000 IU or less per day was 3.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 7.3).",vitamin A,7477116,2
"For vitamin A from supplements alone, the ratio of the prevalence among the babies born to women who consumed more than 10,000 IU per day to that among the babies whose mothers consumed 5000 IU or less per day was 4.8 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.2 to 10.5).",vitamin A,7477116,2
"Using a smoothed regression curve, we found an apparent threshold near 10,000 IU per day of supplemental vitamin A.",vitamin A,7477116,2
The increased frequency of defects was concentrated among the babies born to women who had consumed high levels of vitamin A before the seventh week of gestation.,vitamin A,7477116,3
High dietary intake of preformed vitamin A appears to be teratogenic.,vitamin A,7477116,3
"Among the babies born to women who took more than 10,000 IU of preformed vitamin A per day in the form of supplements, we estimate that about 1 infant in 57 had a malformation attributable to the supplement.",vitamin A,7477116,2
"In humans, isotretinoin, a synthetic retinoid used in the treatment of severe acne, causes congenital fetal anomalies.",vitamin A,7477116,3
"Lammer et al. estimated that, with fetal exposure to isotretinoin, the risk of a malformation was 25 times greater than normal.",vitamin A,7477116,3
"As in the studies in animals, a specific group of malformations (“retinoic acid embryopathy”), including those of craniofacial, cardiac, thymic, and central nervous system structures, appears to be involved.",vitamin A,7477116,3
Vitamin A supplementation improved height by 0.10 cm/4 mo in children aged <24 mo and by 0.22 cm/4 mo in children aged ≥24 mo.,vitamin A,10648265,4

"Vitamin C (VitC), also known as ascorbic acid or ascorbate, is an essential water-soluble vitamin that plays an important role in human physiology.",vitamin C,34717701,0
"Most of its physiological functions involve its ability to act as an antioxidant or as a cofactor for a wide variety of enzymatic reactions, thereby contributing to stabilisation of the tertiary structure of collagen, norepinephrine synthesis and iron absorption.",vitamin C,34717701,1
Emerging data show that VitC is also a cofactor for newly characterised hydroxylases of the family of Fe-containing 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that regulate gene transcription and cell signalling pathways.,vitamin C,34717701,1

The concept of utilizing VitC as a therapeutic agent for cancer care was first introduced by double Nobel Prize winning chemist Linus Pauling and physician Ewan Cameron almost 50 years ago.,vitamin C,34717701,1
"Specifically, Pauling and Cameron published a number of clinical reports that indicated significantly prolonged survival rates of terminal cancer patients treated with pharmacological doses of VitC (10 g/ day by intravenous infusion for about 10 days and orally thereafter) compared to matched historical controls that did not receive VitC.",vitamin C,34717701,1
Herein lies the essence of much controversy concerning the implementation of VitC in cancer treatment over the past decades.,vitamin C,34717701,0
"An important distinction must therefore be made between orally administered VitC (OC), achieving maximum plasma concentrations of no more than 220 μmol/L of blood, and pharmacological or high-dose IVC, generating plasma concentrations up into the millimolar range (≥ 15 mmol/L), which is needed to kill cancer cells based on pre-clinical studies.",vitamin C,34717701,2
"In light of this, high-dose IVC has re-emerged as a potent anti-cancer agent over the past two decades, with several phase I and a few phase II clinical trials reporting high tolerability and safety with promising signs of efficacy in the treatment of various cancer types, either as monotherapy or as a combination therapy",vitamin C,34717701,1

"Specifically, the contribution of emerging global profiling studies based on proteomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics to these insights will be highlighted",vitamin C,34717701,0
The pioneering clinical studies that initiated the interest in VitC as anticancer agent [6–8] employed VitC as single agent.,vitamin C,34717701,1
"Since then, a great number of clinical and pre-clinical studies have explored high-dose VitC.",vitamin C,34717701,0
"In this section, we briefly summarize the pre-clinical and clinical studies of VitC as monotherapy before elaborating more on the combination therapy studies.",vitamin C,34717701,0
A vast number of studies have shown encouraging anti-cancer activity of VitC at millimolar concentrations (~ 1–20 mM) in pre-clinical models of various cancer types [15].,vitamin C,34717701,2
"The most investigated have been leukaemia [20–24], colon cancer [25–32], melanoma [33–37], pancreatic cancer [14, 31, 38] and prostate cancer [39–41].",vitamin C,34717701,0
"One notable example of the progress in VitC pre-clinical research is the recent work in hard-to-treat Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS) driven tumours, such as KRAS mutant colorectal cancer (CRC) [25, 27, 32].",vitamin C,34717701,1
"Based on prior studies by Yun et al. [32] and Aguilera et al. [25], Cenigaonandia-Campillo et al. [27] used elevated doses of VitC (5–10 mM) in KRAS mutant CRC tumours, both in vitro and in vivo.",vitamin C,34717701,2
"They showed that VitC was able to target common metabolic aberrancies by decreasing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) levels, as well as by dissipating the mitochondrial membrane potential, which could sensitize KRAS mutant CRC cells to current treatments such as chemotherapy.",vitamin C,34717701,1
"Given the importance of developing better treatments for patients with KRAS driven tumours, non-toxic combinations with VitC are also being explored and will be discussed in the following section 2.",vitamin C,34717701,0
"In the majority of cancer types, most of the in vivo studies have shown inhibition of tumour growth (40–60%) by using elevated doses of ascorbate (1-4 g/kg) either intravenously (IV) or intraperitoneally (IP) [15, 55–57].",vitamin C,34717701,2
"Importantly, in order to maintain VitC levels inside the tumour, daily administration is the most optimal schedule [56].",vitamin C,34717701,2
"In terms of safety and tolerability, several studies have shown that high-dose VitC does not increase toxicity levels in vivo yet protects from other treatment side-effects when used as an adjuvant agent [15, 62–64].",vitamin C,34717701,1
"Overall, the studies performed in vitro and in vivo using high-dose VitC as single agent in a large number of cancer types, have shown that it is a promising anti-cancer agent impairing both tumor growth and metastasis.",vitamin C,34717701,1
"Clinical monotherapy studies administering high-dose VitC in patients with various types of advanced malignancies report this therapy to be safe, showing no significant toxicity at doses of up to 3 g/kg [13] (Table 2).",vitamin C,34717701,1
"These studies additionally demonstrated that at the given doses, ascorbate plasma levels of over 10 mM could be sustained for several hours, and observed maximum achievable blood concentrations of up to 49 mM [13].",vitamin C,34717701,2
"Grade 3 or higher adverse events possibly related to IVC treatment were reported in only 1–2 cases per study (with 17–24 patients included per study, see Table 2), the most common being hypokalemia [13, 65], hypernatremia [13], hypertension and anemia [66].",vitamin C,34717701,3
"Riordan et al. [65] additionally reported one case of kidney stones in a metastatic CRC patient with a history of renal calculi, suggesting IVC may be contraindicated for patients with renal dysfunction.",vitamin C,34717701,3

"By the 1970s, Nobel Price winner Linus Pauling had already developed a strategy to use intravenous (IV) vitamin C in cancer patients.",vitamin C,31035414,1
He treated patients with advanced cancer with high doses of vitamin C and reported a positive effect on survival.,vitamin C,31035414,1
Pharmacokinetic studies show that the way of administration makes a big difference as peak plasma vitamin C concentrations after intravenous administration are much higher (up to 70-fold) than after oral intake.,vitamin C,31035414,2
"Peak plasma concentrations also continue to increase when the intravenous dose of vitamin C is increased, while peak plasma concentrations plateau around 220 µM even though oral doses are increased.",vitamin C,31035414,2
In preclinical studies investigators also show that vitamin C can have a synergetic effect with some types of chemo- and immunotherapy.,vitamin C,31035414,1
"Additionally we showed in pre-clinical studies that vitamin C has an important role in the immune system, as it stimulates the production and/or activation of immune cells, like T-lymphocytes and natural killer cells, that have a function in fighting against pathogens and cancer cells [12,13,14].",vitamin C,31035414,1
In our previous research on vitamin C we noticed that many of our patients receiving intensive chemotherapy and/or stem cell transplantations for hematological malignancies have low vitamin C plasma concentrations [15].,vitamin C,31035414,3
"In extension of our results, other researchers observed that low vitamin C plasma levels in patients with various types of advanced cancer were associated with worse survival [16].",vitamin C,31035414,1
"Boosting their immune system with vitamin C to hasten immune recovery and thereby prevent infectious complications is attractive, since vitamin C is cheap and generally available.",vitamin C,31035414,1
"We focused on administration route, efficacy and on the side-effects in combination with or without other cancer treatment.",vitamin C,31035414,0
Higher body weight is known to negatively impact plasma vitamin C status.,vitamin C,35406073,4
"However, despite this well-documented inverse association, recommendations on daily vitamin C intakes by health authorities worldwide do not include particular reference values for people of higher body weight.",vitamin C,35406073,4
This suggests that people of higher body weight and people with obesity may be receiving insufficient vitamin C in spite of ingesting the amounts recommended by their health authorities.,vitamin C,35406073,4
The current preliminary investigation sought to estimate how much additional vitamin C people with higher body weights would need to consume in order to attain a comparable vitamin C status to that of a lower weight person consuming an average Western vitamin C intake.,vitamin C,35406073,3
"Our estimates suggest that an additional intake of 10 mg vitamin C/day is required for every 10 kg increase in body weight to attain a comparable plasma concentration to a 60 kg individual with a vitamin C intake of ~110 mg/day, which is the daily intake recommended by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA).",vitamin C,35406073,2
"Thus, individuals weighing e.g., 80 and 90 kg will need to consume ~130 and 140 mg vitamin C/day, respectively.",vitamin C,35406073,2
People with obesity will likely need even higher vitamin C intakes.,vitamin C,35406073,3
"As such, dose-finding studies are required to determine optimal vitamin C intakes for overweight and obese people.",vitamin C,35406073,3
"Higher body weight is known to negatively impact vitamin C status, with an inverse association observed between body weight and plasma ascorbate concentrations reported in numerous epidemiological studies [1,2].",vitamin C,35406073,4
"Firstly, increased body weight correlates with an increased volume of distribution, which from a purely volumetric perspective results in a lower plasma concentration from the same intake with increased body weight [3,4].",vitamin C,35406073,4
"In fact, this relationship constitutes the basis of the lower recommended daily intake for women compared to men in some countries [5].",vitamin C,35406073,4
This study showed decreasing vitamin C status with increasing body weight in participants receiving an identical dietary intake of vitamin C.,vitamin C,35406073,4
We have also previously shown that the lack of response to low dose vitamin C supplementation in participants with hypovitaminosis C was partly due to body weight [9].,vitamin C,35406073,4
"However, with increasing obesity rates becoming a global pandemic [10], the negative impact of higher body weight on vitamin C status should be taken into consideration in public health recommendations.",vitamin C,35406073,4
"Furthermore, obesity is a major risk factor for severe cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [11].",vitamin C,35406073,0
"These diseases have also been associated with depleted vitamin C status, although body weight per se also appears to be a major predictor of vitamin C status in these conditions [12,13].",vitamin C,35406073,3
The Block study [8] comprised 68 healthy men who underwent two vitamin C depletion and repletion phases.,vitamin C,35406073,0
"The participants did not smoke, drink alcohol, or take aspirin during the study, and consumed only the food and drink provided.",vitamin C,35406073,0
"The final regression model for the second repletion phase was as follows: AUC = −168.5 + 7.6 × AA + 95.7 × dose, R2 = 0.55, where AUC is the area under the plasma ascorbate repletion curve (for phase 2); AA is the plasma ascorbic acid values at the beginning of the second repletion cycle; and dose is the vitamin C intake per kg of body weight [8].",vitamin C,35406073,2
"Exclusion criteria were cigarette smoking, use of regular medications, history of kidney stones, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, diabetes mellitus, bleeding disorders, or family history of iron overload/hemochromatosis.",vitamin C,35406073,0
During depletion they consumed a diet of <5 mg/d vitamin C.,vitamin C,35406073,2
"This curve displayed sigmoidal kinetics: AA = 7.4 + (dose4.3) × 61.5/(dose4.3 + 109 × 106), where AA is the ascorbic acid concentration and dose is the vitamin C intake.",vitamin C,35406073,2
"The mean plasma ascorbate concentration attained following depletion was 13 ± 2 µmol/L, and repletion with 117 mg/day vitamin C provided a mean plasma concentration of 49 ± 14 µmol/L.",vitamin C,35406073,2
"This resulted in estimated doses of 109, 97, 84, and 77 mg/day (to obtain the predicted plasma concentrations of 59, 54, 46, and 41 µmol/L, respectively).",vitamin C,35406073,2
"The 117 mg/day dose administered in the Block study equated to an estimated 61 µmol/L plasma ascorbate concentration using the Levine curve, i.e., a mere 2 µmol/L more than the plasma concentration predicted in the Block study for the lowest body weight (i.e., 59 µmol/L for 59 kg person), suggesting that the predicted data for the low body weight category in the Block study was an excellent fit to the Levine dose-concentration data.",vitamin C,35406073,2
"This investigation, drawing on previously published data [8], shows a considerable body weight dependency when translating the same daily intake of vitamin C to the corresponding steady-state plasma ascorbate concentration.",vitamin C,35406073,4
"Our estimates suggest that within a weight range of approximately 60–90 kg, an additional 10 mg/day vitamin C intake is required for each 10 kg increase in body weight to attain a comparable plasma concentration to that of a 60 kg individual ingesting 110 mg vitamin C/day.",vitamin C,35406073,2
"This corresponds to 140 mg/day for a 90 kg person, which was the highest body weight data available for this study.",vitamin C,35406073,2
"However, extrapolating the relationship between body weight and dose beyond 90 kg suggested that the 10 mg/10 kg increase in requirement tapers off when approaching 120 kg body weight.",vitamin C,35406073,3
"Consequently, the volume of distribution for ascorbate, being a highly water-soluble molecule, is unlikely to increase proportionally to weight gain over the full range of obesity.",vitamin C,35406073,4
"Thus, correcting exclusively for volumetric dilution of vitamin C may not be appropriate for weights over about 110 kg.",vitamin C,35406073,4
"A vitamin C intake of 110 mg/day is the recommended dietary intake of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and other European countries (e.g., France, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland) [5].",vitamin C,35406073,2
"This intake is to attain a plasma ascorbate concentration of 50 µmol/L, which is considered adequate [19].",vitamin C,35406073,2
"Of note, even with a slightly higher intake (i.e., 117 mg/day), participants in the Block study with body weights >80 kg had predicted plasma vitamin C concentrations <50 µmol/L [8].",vitamin C,35406073,2
"Many countries globally have recommended vitamin C intakes well below 110 mg/day, some as low as 40 mg/day [5], which provide inadequate plasma concentrations [17], even in people of lower body weight, such as 59 kg [20].",vitamin C,35406073,2
"Therefore, future studies are needed to determine the vitamin C requirements for overweight and obese people in particular.",vitamin C,35406073,4
The role of body weight as a significant contributor to attained steady-state plasma ascorbate concentrations should be considered in making public health recommendations.,vitamin C,35406073,4
"Because recommended vitamin C intakes expressed as mg/day will result in lower plasma ascorbate concentrations in higher weight relative to lower weight people, more than 20 years ago Block et al. [8] indicated that dietary recommendations should be based on a dose per kg body weight, or in terms of a desirable plasma concentration.",vitamin C,35406073,4
"Alternatively, targeted recommendations are needed for people with higher body weight.",vitamin C,35406073,4
It is noteworthy that authorities of many countries have already issued special increased recommended daily intakes of vitamin C for subpopulations with increased risk of vitamin C deficiency such as smokers and pregnant and lactating women [5].,vitamin C,35406073,3
"The results from the current investigation suggest that to attain comparable plasma concentrations to a 60 kg person consuming an average vitamin C intake of 110 mg/day, i.e., the daily intake recommended by most European countries, an additional 10 mg/day of vitamin C would be required for each additional 10 kg increase in body weight.",vitamin C,35406073,2
"As such, higher weight people (e.g., 80–90 kg) will require estimated vitamin C intakes of 130–140 mg/day.",vitamin C,35406073,2
Vitamin C status is inversely related to body mass.,vitamin C,15930480,4
"They suggest that vitamin C has a generally positive preventive or protective effect, though no study has shown complete compensation for the damage caused by nicotine.",vitamin C,39985757,1
"If this is not achievable despite intensive efforts by medical personnel, vitamin C supplementation during pregnancy may be considered.",vitamin C,39985757,3
"With a very low side effect profile, a daily dose of up to 500 mg can be recommended.",vitamin C,39985757,2
The authors reviewed existing studies that focused on the effects of maternal nicotine use and the potential protective role of vitamin C supplementation.,vitamin C,39985757,1
They sought to determine whether vitamin C could prevent or reduce the harm caused by nicotine exposure during pregnancy.,vitamin C,39985757,3
"The studies reviewed showed generally positive results, indicating that vitamin C supplementation may have a protective effect against some of the damage caused by nicotine use during pregnancy.",vitamin C,39985757,3
"The researchers suggested that a daily dose of 500 mg of vitamin C during pregnancy might offer some benefit, particularly for women who feel unable to quit smoking.",vitamin C,39985757,2
The effect of combined vitamin C and E supplementation during pregnancy on the prevention of preeclampsia and major adverse infant outcomes has been reviewed.,vitamin C,17306042,3
"There were no significant differences between the vitamin and placebo groups in the risk of preeclampsia, fetal or neonatal loss, or small for gestational age (SGA) infant.",vitamin C,17306042,3
"Combined vitamin C and E supplementation during pregnancy does not reduce the risk of preeclampsia, fetal or neonatal loss, small for gestational age infant, or preterm birth.",vitamin C,17306042,3
"Specifically, we demonstrate the succession of antioxidants from maternal diet to breast milk composition, and extend the conception of their impact on the development of atopic disease in the infant.",vitamin C,15340369,3
The mean intake of vitamin C from diet was 124 mg/day (range 40–279) and vitamin E (expressed as tocopherol equivalents) 8.3 mg/day (range 5.2–16.8).,vitamin C,15340369,2
"Altogether 17/34 (50%) of the mothers were using supplements containing vitamin C and 15/34 (44%) vitamin E, median intake from supplements 75 and 10 mg/day, respectively.",vitamin C,15340369,2
"Several populations warrant special attention with respect to vitamin C requirements. These include patients with periodontal disease, smokers, pregnant and lactating women, and the elderly.",vitamin C,15150630,3
"Some studies found that women who experienced PROM had significantly lower vitamin C blood levels than those who did not, while others found no significant differences.",vitamin C,38775321,3
Conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine if there was a significant difference in vitamin C blood levels in women who had PROM versus the control group who did not and to determine if vitamin C supplements could help prevent it.,vitamin C,38775321,3
"Twenty-five studies (26 reports) met all eligibility criteria, with 18 studies (18 reports) assessing vitamin C levels and seven studies (eight reports) evaluating efficacy.",vitamin C,38775321,3
"Women with PROM, whether preterm or term, had significantly lower vitamin C levels [Hedges’ g, -1.48; 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.82, -0.14; p = 0.020; I2 = 94.08%) and specifically preterm PROM after removing the outlying study [Hedges’ g, -1.29; 95% CI: -1.85, -0.73; p < 0.001; I2 = 87.35%).",vitamin C,38775321,3
"Vitamin C supplementation significantly reduced the risk of preterm or term PROM [risk ratio (RR), 0.57; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.81; p < 0.001; I2 = 12.17%), particularly for preterm PROM (RR, 0.67; 95% CI: 0.45, 0.99; p = 0.001; I2 = 0.00%).",vitamin C,38775321,3
"There were no significant differences in vitamin C levels between women with term PROM and controls, and there were no differences in the risk of developing term PROM between women taking vitamin C supplements and controls.",vitamin C,38775321,3
"Women with PROM, particularly those who developed it preterm, appear to have significantly lower vitamin C levels, and vitamin C supplementation appears to be effective in reducing the risk of PROM, particularly preterm PROM.",vitamin C,38775321,3
Some studies found that vitamin C blood levels in women who experienced PROM were significantly lower than those who did not.,vitamin C,38775321,3
"However, some older systematic reviews and meta-analyses have examined the effects of vitamin C supplementation in the prevention of PROM, with conflicting results.",vitamin C,38775321,3
"First, published in 2015 reported that vitamin C supplementation alone could lower the risk of both PPROM and TPROM.",vitamin C,38775321,3
"However, two subsequent systematic reviews and meta-analyses (one conducted in 2017 and published as a congress abstract in 2018 and another published in 2022) found that vitamin C was ineffective in reducing the risk of PPROM.",vitamin C,38775321,3
"Considering that membrane rupture has been linked to increased oxidative stress and abnormalities in collagen formation and structure, vitamin C may be effective in preventing PROM, particularly PPROM, due to its antioxidant properties and role in collagen synthesis.",vitamin C,38775321,3
Three studies found a significant effect on PROM/PPROM with a daily dose of 100 mg.,vitamin C,38775321,2
"Higher doses of 500 or 1,000 mg per day resulted in insignificantly lower rates of PROM/PPROM.",vitamin C,38775321,2
"So, 100 mg daily appears to be sufficient for reducing the risk of PROM, particularly PPROM.",vitamin C,38775321,2
"The recommended daily intake of vitamin C during pregnancy is 85 and 105 mg in the United States and the European Union, respectively, with 2,000 mg/day being considered the tolerable upper limit in pregnancy in the United States.",vitamin C,38775321,2
In adults the duration of colds was reduced by 8% (3% to 12%) and in children by 14% (7% to 21%).,vitamin C,23440782,4
"However, only a few therapeutic trials have been carried out and none have examined children, although the effect of prophylactic vitamin C has been greater in children.",vitamin C,23440782,4
Ritzel 1961 had reported a brief randomised trial of children at a ski school in the Swiss Alps in which he administered 1 g of vitamin C daily and found significantly reduced incidence and duration of colds in children who were administered vitamin C.,vitamin C,23440782,4
"A further meta‐analysis found a trend for trials with children to show greater benefit than trials with adults, and another trend for trials with ≥ 2 g/day to show greater benefit than trials with 1 g/day, suggesting dose‐dependency (Hemilä 1999a).",vitamin C,23440782,4
b) children are on average smaller so that a fixed dose corresponds to a greater dose per weight.,vitamin C,23440782,4
"For children, the pooled effect was a 14.2% (7.3% to 21%) reduction in common cold duration, and for adults the pooled effect was a 7.7% (3.7% to 12%) reduction in cold duration.",vitamin C,23440782,4
"In the Constantini 2011a trial, common cold duration was significantly shorter in male swimmers, but not in female swimmers, there being a statistically significant interaction between vitamin C effect and sex.",vitamin C,23440782,4
"When we removed the trials using < 1 g/day of vitamin C (Miller 1977b; Miller 1977c; Wilson 1973a; Wilson 1973b), the pooled estimate of benefit was increased to a 18.1% (9% to 27%) reduction in the duration of colds in children suggesting that the 14.2% estimate for all studies of children may be biased downwards because low‐dose trials are included.",vitamin C,23440782,4
"In the adult subgroup, the estimate of effect was essentially unchanged, 8.0% (3.8% to 12%), when the < 1 g/day vitamin C trials were removed (Peters 1993a; Peters 1993b; Peters 1996a; Peters 1996b); these are small trials with doses of 0.5 to 0.6 g/day.",vitamin C,23440782,4
"In summary, this meta‐analysis of the duration of colds occurring while participants were on regular vitamin C supplementation demonstrated a statistically highly significant, but modest, benefit to the vitamin C supplemented participants which was greater in children than in adults.",vitamin C,23440782,4
The estimated effect of vitamin C was 8% for adults and 14% for children.,vitamin C,23440782,4
"Given that adults have a few colds per year and children have half a dozen or so, it does not seem reasonable to take vitamin C regularly all year to shorten a few colds slightly.",vitamin C,23440782,4
"Across the available trials, there is more evidence for the difference between children and adults than on the variation of vitamin C effect by the dose used.",vitamin C,23440782,4
"None of the therapeutic trials examined the effect of vitamin C on children, although children have a substantially higher incidence of the common cold.",vitamin C,23440782,4
"Furthermore, the effect of regular vitamin C on the duration of colds has been substantially greater in children, up to 18% reduction in duration by 1 g or 2 g/day, compared with adults (8%), which also motivates therapeutic trials in particular with children.",vitamin C,23440782,4
